# Project 3 - Self Reflection
Whitworth University - CS-357 Computer Graphics  

## Overview / Purpose

Spend 15 minutes filling this out. Rushing through it will not really help the leaning opportunity, which is to solidify and reflect on the experience of working on this project. I am not going to evaluate your reflection much more than 'did you do it?' That is not to remove the expectation, but to free you to use this space effectively. This is for your benefit, not mine.  

You are going to need to leave room in your schedule to fill this out. Plan accordingly.


You are going to grade yourself. Put in what point values you think are appropriate in the 'Self-Evaluation' colum. I am going to fill in the Points Given colum when I grade this.

Meaningfully answer the questions below.

## Reflection

### What went well? What surprised you in a good way? What do you feel proud about?

I made the models, put them in a scene, and got the camera to work, so that part went well. The camera and perspective projections were very confusing so I am 
glad I was able to understand it and implement it, using references from Scott's code. I was surprised at how confusing it is.

### What barriers were there? Where was the friction?

Understanding perspective projection and camera was the barrier, it took me a while to get the objects to appear on screen. That and also getting the camera 
to behave the way I want it to, I was confusing between camera position and the place it was looking at for a while. Clipping space and frustrum was a barrier as well. 

### If you didn't finish, where did you get stuck? What were your next steps going to be?
I finished but I was stuck for a while trying to get the camera to follow the mouse.

### Do you have any questions you are going to ask in class and/or in office hours? I.e. do you need any actionable feedback?
